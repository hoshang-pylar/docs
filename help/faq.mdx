### What data sources can I connect to Pylar?

Pylar supports two types of data sources:

**Business Applications** (synced to Pylar Warehouse):
- Google Sheets, HubSpot, Salesforce, Airtable, and more

**Databases and Data Warehouses** (indexed, data stays in place):
- BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift, MotherDuck, Supabase, AlloyDB, Databricks, and more

</Card>

### Do I need to give Pylar direct database access?

For databases and data warehouses, you need to:
1. Provide connection credentials (host, database name, username, password)
2. Whitelist Pylar's IP address: `34.122.205.142`

However, Pylar only indexes your data for querying and autocompletion. Your data remains in its original location, and queries are executed on your infrastructure. Agents never get raw database access—only through views you create.

</Card>

### Can I connect multiple instances of the same data source?

Yes! You can connect multiple instances of the same data source (e.g., multiple Google Sheets documents, multiple Snowflake databases). Each connection must have a unique name following these rules:
- Lowercase letters only
- Numbers and underscores allowed
- No spaces or special characters

### How do I name my connections?

Connection names must follow these rules:
- ✅ **Allowed**: Lowercase letters, numbers, underscores
- ❌ **Not Allowed**: Capital letters, special characters, spaces

**Good examples**: `production_db`, `snowflake_analytics`, `customer_data_v2`
**Bad examples**: `Production DB`, `snowflake-analytics`, `Customer Data`

This name will be used in SQL queries to reference the connection.

### What happens after I connect a data source?

After connecting:
- **Business Applications**: Data syncs to Pylar Warehouse (may take time depending on data volume)
- **Databases**: Data is indexed for querying (your data stays in place)

You'll receive an email and in-app notification when the sync/indexing is complete and you can start querying.

### Can I use SSH connections for enhanced security?

Yes! Pylar supports SSH tunnel connections for enhanced security. This involves:
1. Setting up a bastion VM in your VPC
2. Installing the database auth proxy
3. Configuring SSH key authentication
4. Connecting through the SSH tunnel

This provides maximum security for sensitive databases.
