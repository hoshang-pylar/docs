## Why Choose Pylar?

Pylar solves critical challenges in AI agent development by providing a secure, governed data access layer. Here's why organizations choose Pylar over building custom solutions or giving agents direct database access.

## Security & Governance First

### Fine-Grained Access Control

Unlike direct database connections, Pylar lets you define exactly what data agents can access at the view, column, and row level. This means you can:

- **Restrict Sensitive Data**: Automatically mask or exclude PII, financial data, or other sensitive information
- **Row-Level Security**: Control access based on user context, regions, or business rules
- **Query Validation**: Prevent unauthorized queries before they reach your database
- **Audit Every Access**: Track who accessed what data and when

<Tip>
With Pylar, you can start with read-only access to non-sensitive data and gradually expand as you build confidence in your governance policies.
</Tip>

### Compliance Ready

Pylar helps you meet regulatory requirements out of the box:

- **Complete Audit Trails**: Every query is logged with full context
- **Data Lineage**: Understand where data came from and how it's used
- **Access Controls**: Enforce policies that meet SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and other standards
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation for compliance reviews

<Warning>
Direct database access makes compliance nearly impossible. Pylar provides the governance layer you need.
</Warning>

## Developer Experience

### AI-Powered Tool Creation

Instead of writing custom integrations, use natural language to create MCP tools:

- **Natural Language Prompts**: Write "create a tool to fetch error codes, events, and deal information" and Pylar's AI configures it
- **Manual Control Available**: Fine-tune tools manually when needed
- **Multiple Tools Per View**: Create different tools on the same view for flexibility
- **Test Before Deploy**: Verify tools work correctly before publishing
- **Standard Protocol**: Uses MCP, the emerging standard for AI tooling

### One View, Multiple Tools

Create multiple MCP tools on a single view, each governing how agents interact with your data differently. All tools work with any MCP-compatible agent:

- Claude Desktop
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Custom agent frameworks
- Any MCP-compatible tool

Write your data access logic once, create multiple tools, use everywhere.

### Rapid Iteration Without Redeployment

- **Adjust Anytime**: Update queries, view scope, or tools on the platform
- **Automatic Propagation**: Changes reflect everywhere automatically—no redeployment needed
- **Test Before Publish**: Test MCP tools before deploying to ensure they work
- **Iterative Improvement**: Use Evals insights to refine views and tools continuously

## Operational Excellence

### In-Depth Evals & Observability

Click "Evals" to get comprehensive insights into how agents interact with your views:

- **Interaction Patterns**: See exactly how agents use your tools
- **Success vs. Errors**: Track successful queries and identify failures
- **Error Analysis**: Detailed breakdown—what errors occurred, when, and why
- **Query Shape**: Understand the types of queries agents are making
- **Raw Logs**: Access full query logs for debugging
- **Iterative Optimization**: Use insights to adjust view scope and tool configurations

### Scalability Without Headaches

Pylar scales with you:

- **Multi-Database Support**: Connect to BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, and more
- **Cross-Database Joins**: Join data across multiple databases in a single query
- **Project Organization**: Organize views and tools in projects for better management
- **SQL IDE**: Built-in SQL editor for easy query development
- **Views Are the Only Access**: Agents never get raw database access—complete security

<Info>
Start small with one database and one view. Scale to hundreds of views across multiple data sources as you grow. All within projects that keep everything organized.
</Info>

## Cost Efficiency

### Reduce Development Time

Building custom agent integrations typically takes weeks or months. With Pylar:

- **Days Instead of Months**: Get your first tools running in hours
- **No Maintenance Burden**: Pylar handles protocol updates and compatibility
- **Focus on Value**: Spend time on your business logic, not infrastructure

### Lower Infrastructure Costs

- **Connection Efficiency**: Shared connections reduce database load
- **Query Optimization**: Built-in query analysis and optimization
- **Caching Layer**: Reduce redundant queries and costs
- **Resource Management**: Prevent runaway queries that spike costs
