</Warning>

## Step 2: Create a Project

Projects are containers for your views and MCP tools. All your work is organized within projects.

1. From the dashboard, click **Create Project**
2. Give your project a name (e.g., "Customer Analytics" or "Error Monitoring")
3. Optionally add a description
4. Click **Create**

<Check>
Your project is now ready. You can create multiple projects to organize different use cases or teams.
</Check>

## Step 3: Create Your First View

Views define what data AI agents can access. They're the only level of access agents get—no raw database access.

### Open the SQL IDE

1. In your project, click **Create View**
2. The SQL IDE opens with your available data sources

### Select Your Data Source

1. Choose a data source from the dropdown
2. You can see available databases, schemas, and tables
3. Select the database you want to query

### Write Your Query

Use the SQL IDE to write your query. You can:

- **Query Single Tables**: Select from individual tables
- **Join Multiple Tables**: Combine data from multiple tables
- **Cross-Database Joins**: Join across different databases and warehouses in a single query
- **Apply Filters**: Use WHERE clauses to filter data
- **Aggregate Data**: Use GROUP BY, aggregations, and window functions

<Info>
Pylar's SQL IDE supports all standard SQL operations. You can write complex queries just like you would in any SQL editor.
</Info>

### Example: Customer Analytics View

```sql
-- Customer Analytics View
-- This view provides aggregated customer data for AI analysis
-- without exposing PII or sensitive financial details

SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.region,
  c.signup_date,
  COUNT(o.order_id) as total_orders,
  SUM(o.amount) as total_revenue,
  AVG(o.amount) as avg_order_value,
  MAX(o.order_date) as last_order_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.is_active = true
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.region, c.signup_date;
```

### Example: Cross-Database Join

```sql
-- Join data across multiple databases
SELECT 
  customers.name,
  orders.total,
  payments.status
FROM bigquery.production.customers customers
JOIN snowflake.analytics.orders orders 
  ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
JOIN postgres.payments.payments payments
  ON orders.id = payments.order_id
WHERE orders.date >= '2024-01-01';
```

### Save Your View

1. Click **Save View** when your query is ready
2. Give your view a descriptive name
3. Add a description (this helps when creating MCP tools)
4. Your view is now saved in your project

<Tip>
Test your query in the SQL IDE before saving. You can preview results to ensure the data looks correct.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Create MCP Tools

Once your view is created, you can build MCP tools that govern how AI agents interact with your data. You can create multiple MCP tools on a single view, each with different purposes.

### Method 1: Create with AI (Recommended)

Use natural language to describe what you want, and Pylar's AI will configure the MCP tool for you.

1. Click **Create MCP Tool** on your view
2. Select **Create with AI**
3. Write a natural language prompt describing what you want:

   Example prompts:
   - *"Create a tool to fetch error codes, events, and deal information"*
   - *"Build a tool that returns customer analytics by region"*
   - *"Make a tool to get order history for a specific customer"*

4. Pylar's AI will:
   - Understand your intent
   - Configure tool parameters
   - Generate tool descriptions
   - Set up the tool schema

5. Review the generated tool configuration
6. Make any adjustments if needed
7. Click **Save Tool**

### Method 2: Create Manually

For more control, you can configure the tool manually:

1. Click **Create MCP Tool** on your view
2. Select **Create Manually**
3. Configure:
   - **Tool Name**: Descriptive name for the tool
   - **Description**: What the tool does
   - **Parameters**: Input parameters the tool accepts
   - **Query Logic**: How parameters map to your SQL view
   - **Response Format**: Structure of returned data

4. Click **Save Tool**

<Check>
You can create multiple MCP tools on the same view. Each tool can have different parameters, filters, or purposes, giving you flexibility in how agents interact with your data.
</Check>

## Step 5: Test Your MCP Tools

Before deploying, test your MCP tools to ensure they work correctly.

1. Click on any MCP tool you've created
2. Select **Test Tool**
3. Enter test parameters
4. Click **Run Test**
5. Review the results:
   - Verify the query executes correctly
   - Check the response format
   - Ensure data is returned as expected
   - Look for any errors

<Tip>
Testing helps catch issues before deploying to production. Test with various parameter combinations to ensure robustness.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Publish Your Tools

Once your MCP tools are ready, publish them to make them available to AI agents.

1. In your project, click **Publish**
2. Pylar generates:
   - **MCP Server Link**: A unique URL for your tools
   - **Header Token**: An authentication token for secure access

3. Copy both the link and the header token

<Warning>
Keep your header token secure. It provides access to your data views. Don't share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Step 7: Connect to Your Agent Builder

Add your published tools to any agent builder that supports MCP.

### Add to Agent Builder

1. Open your agent builder (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
2. Navigate to MCP configuration settings
3. Add a new MCP server:
   - **Server URL**: Paste your MCP server link
   - **Authorization Header**: Add your header token (format: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`)
4. Save and restart your agent

### Verify Connection

1. In your agent, ask it to use your new tool
2. The agent should be able to access your data view
3. Test a few queries to ensure everything works

<Check>
Your tools are now live! The agent can query your data through the governed views you created.
</Check>

## Step 8: Monitor with Evals

Once your agent is running, use Pylar's Evals to understand how agents interact with your views.

### Access Evals

1. In your Pylar dashboard, click **Evals**
2. Select your project and view
3. Explore comprehensive analytics

### What You'll See

Evals provide in-depth insights:

- **Interaction Patterns**: How agents are using your tools
- **Success vs. Errors**: Track successful queries and failures
- **Error Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of errors:
  - What errors occurred
  - When they happened
  - Why they failed
  - How to fix them
- **Query Shape**: Understand the types of queries agents are making
- **Raw Logs**: Access full query logs for debugging

### Use Evals to Improve

Based on evals insights, you can:

1. **Adjust View Scope**: Modify your SQL views to include or exclude data
2. **Refine MCP Tools**: Update tool parameters or descriptions
3. **Add New Tools**: Create additional tools for common use cases
4. **Fix Errors**: Address issues revealed in the error analysis

### Changes Reflect Automatically

1. Make your changes in the Pylar platform
2. Changes are automatically reflected in all connected agent builders
3. No need to redeploy or reconfigure agents
4. Agents immediately have access to updated views and tools

<Tip>
Start simple and expand based on evals insights. You can always refine your views and tools as you learn how agents interact with your data.
</Tip>

## Key Concepts

### Views Are the Only Access Level

**Important**: AI agents never get raw database access. They can only query through the views you create. This means:

- ✅ Complete control over what data agents can see
- ✅ No risk of agents accessing unauthorized data
- ✅ All queries go through your defined views
- ✅ Full audit trail of all data access

### Multiple Tools on One View

A single view can have multiple MCP tools, each with different purposes:

- Different parameter sets
- Different query filters
- Different use cases
- Different agent interaction patterns

This flexibility lets you tailor how different agents or use cases interact with the same underlying data.
