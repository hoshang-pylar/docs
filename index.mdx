## Welcome to Pylar

Pylar is a **secure data access layer for AI agents** that enables interaction with structured data sources without requiring direct database access or complex API integrations.

## How It Works

![Pylar Workflow Diagram](/images/pylar-workflow.svg)

1. **Data Sources** connect to Pylar (Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, HubSpot, Salesforce, and more)
2. **SQL View** is created to govern exactly what data agents can access
3. **MCP Tools** are built on the view—multiple tools for different use cases
4. **Tools publish** to Agent Builders (Claude Desktop, Cursor, LangGraph, Zapier, Make, n8n, and more)
5. **Evals** monitors all tool interactions for observability and optimization

**Key Benefits**:

- ✅ **Single Control Pane**: Update views and tools without redeploying agents
- ✅ **No Raw Access**: Agents only access data through your governed views
- ✅ **Unified Interface**: One MCP endpoint for all data sources
- ✅ **Real-time Observability**: Monitor all agent interactions with Evals

## Key Features

### 🔒 Governed SQL Views

Create SQL views that define exactly what data agents can access. Views are the only access level—agents never get raw database access.

### 🤖 AI-Powered MCP Tool Creation

Describe what you want in natural language, and Pylar's AI generates MCP tools for your agents. No manual coding required.

### 🔗 Multi-Database Integration

Join data across multiple databases, warehouses, and business applications. Query Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, HubSpot, Salesforce, and more—all in one place.

### 📊 Built-in Observability

Monitor agent performance with the Evals dashboard. Track errors, query patterns, and optimize your tools based on real usage data.

### 🚀 One Control Pane

Update views and tools without redeploying agents. Changes reflect immediately across all agent builders—Claude Desktop, Cursor, LangGraph, Zapier, and more.

### Step 3: Build MCP Tools

Create MCP tools using AI or manually. Each tool defines how agents interact with your views.
