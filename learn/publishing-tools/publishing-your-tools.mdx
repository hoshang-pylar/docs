## Prerequisites

Before publishing, ensure:

- ✅ Your MCP tools are created and tested
- ✅ Tools work correctly (tested successfully)
- ✅ You're ready to make tools available to agents

<Info>
Only publish tools that have been tested and verified to work correctly. Publishing untested tools can lead to agent errors.
</Info>

## Step 1: Publish Your Tools

### Access the Publish Button

1. Navigate to your project in Pylar
2. Look for the **"Publish"** button in the right sidebar
3. Click **"Publish"** to begin

### What Happens

When you click Publish:
- Pylar prepares your tools for deployment
- Validates all tool configurations
- Generates secure access credentials
- Makes tools available via MCP server

## Step 2: Generate Access Credentials

After clicking Publish, a popup window appears.

### Generate Token

1. In the popup, click **"Generate Token"**
2. Pylar creates a secure authorization token
3. The token is unique to your project
4. Token provides secure access to your tools

<Tip>
Tokens are generated securely and can be regenerated if needed. Store them safely and never share publicly.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Copy Connection Details

Once the token is generated, you'll see two critical values:

### MCP HTTP Stream URL

The URL where your MCP server is accessible:

```
https://mcp.publish.pylar.ai/mcp
```

**What it's for**: Agent builders use this URL to connect to your MCP server.

### Authorization Bearer Token

The authentication token for secure access:

```
Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**What it's for**: Provides secure authentication when agents connect to your tools.

<Warning>
Copy both values carefully. You'll need both to connect your tools to agent builders. The Bearer Token should be kept secure.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Store Credentials Safely

### Security Best Practices

- ✅ **Store Securely**: Use password managers or secure storage
- ✅ **Don't Share Publicly**: Never commit tokens to version control
- ✅ **Regenerate if Compromised**: Generate new tokens if exposed
- ✅ **Limit Access**: Only share with authorized team members

### Where to Store

- Password manager (1Password, LastPass, etc.)
- Secure team documentation (with access controls)
- Environment variables (for programmatic access)
- Secure configuration files (never commit to git)

## Understanding Your Credentials

### MCP HTTP Stream URL

This is the standard endpoint for MCP servers:

- **Format**: `https://mcp.publish.pylar.ai/mcp`
- **Purpose**: Agent builders connect here
- **Protocol**: Uses MCP (Machine-Consumable Protocol)
- **Security**: Protected by Bearer Token authentication

<Info>
The MCP HTTP Stream URL is the same for all Pylar projects. Your Bearer Token is what makes your connection unique and secure.
</Info>

### Authorization Bearer Token

This token authenticates your connection:

- **Format**: `Bearer <token_string>`
- **Purpose**: Proves authorized access
- **Scope**: Provides access to your published tools
- **Security**: Keep it secret and secure

### How They Work Together

1. Agent builder connects to MCP HTTP Stream URL
2. Sends Authorization Bearer Token in request headers
3. Pylar validates the token
4. Grants access to your published tools
5. Agent can now call your tools

## What Gets Published

When you publish:

- ✅ **All MCP Tools**: All tools in your project become available
- ✅ **Underlying Views**: Tools can query their associated views
- ✅ **Real-time Access**: Tools are immediately accessible
- ✅ **Automatic Updates**: Changes to tools reflect automatically

<Check>
After publishing, your tools are live and ready for agents to use. You can update tools anytime without republishing.
</Check>
