## Overview

Pylar supports a wide range of data sources, from databases and data warehouses to business applications. This page provides a comprehensive list of all supported sources.

## Databases and Data Warehouses

These sources are indexed for querying while your data remains in its original location:

### Cloud Data Warehouses

- **BigQuery** - Google's serverless data warehouse
- **Snowflake** - Cloud data platform
- **Amazon Redshift** - AWS data warehouse
- **MotherDuck** - Serverless analytics platform
- **Databricks** - Unified analytics platform

### Relational Databases

- **PostgreSQL** - Open-source relational database
- **MySQL** - Popular open-source database
- **AlloyDB** - Google Cloud's PostgreSQL-compatible database
- **Supabase** - Hosted PostgreSQL service

### Additional Databases

- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **Oracle Database**
- And more...

<Info>
For databases and data warehouses, your data stays in its original location. Pylar indexes it for easier querying and executes queries on your infrastructure.

## Business Applications

These sources sync data to Pylar Warehouse:

### CRM and Sales

- **Salesforce** - Customer relationship management
- **HubSpot** - Marketing and sales platform

### Collaboration and Productivity

- **Google Sheets** - Spreadsheet application
- **Airtable** - Database and collaboration platform

### Analytics and Marketing

- **Amplitude** - Product analytics
- **Mixpanel** - Product analytics

## Connection Types Comparison

| Feature | Business Applications | Databases/Data Warehouses |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Data Location | Synced to Pylar Warehouse | Stays in original location |
| Query Execution | On Pylar infrastructure | On your infrastructure |
| Data Freshness | Periodic syncs | Real-time queries |
| Cross-Source Joins | Supported | Supported |
| Setup Complexity | Simple (OAuth usually) | Requires credentials |
| IP Whitelisting | Usually not required | Often required |

## IP Address for Whitelisting

For databases and data warehouses that require IP whitelisting:

**Pylar IP Address**: `34.122.205.142`

This is a permanently assigned IP address. Whitelist it in your database firewall settings to allow Pylar to connect.

<Warning>
Most databases and data warehouses require whitelisting Pylar's IP address (34.122.205.142) in your firewall settings. This is crucial for establishing a secure connection.
</Warning>

## Choosing the Right Source Type

### Use Business Applications When

- You want data synced to Pylar for fast querying
- You need simple, OAuth-based authentication
- You're working with SaaS application data
- You want automated data refreshes

### Use Databases/Data Warehouses When

- You want to query data in place
- You need real-time data access
- You have existing database infrastructure
- You want to avoid data duplication
- You need to join across multiple sources

## Connection Naming

When connecting sources, follow these naming rules:

- ✅ **Allowed**: Lowercase letters, numbers, underscores
- ❌ **Not Allowed**: Capital letters, special characters, spaces

**Examples**:
- ✅ `production_db`
- ✅ `snowflake_analytics`
- ✅ `customer_data_v2`
- ❌ `Production DB`
- ❌ `snowflake-analytics`
- ❌ `Customer Data`

<Tip>
Use descriptive names that indicate the source and purpose. This name will be used in SQL queries to reference the connection.
</Tip>

## Multiple Connections

You can connect:

- **Multiple instances** of the same source type (e.g., multiple Google Sheets)
- **Different sources** to the same workspace
- **Same source** to different workspaces

Each connection must have a **unique name** within your workspace.
