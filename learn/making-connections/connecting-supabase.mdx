---

## Overview

Supabase is a hosted PostgreSQL service. Connecting your Supabase database to Pylar allows you to query and analyze your Supabase data directly from Pylar, just like any PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Pylar account with Analyst role or higher
- ✅ Supabase account with an active project
- ✅ Database password (Supabase does not provide this in connection details)

## Step 1: Log into Supabase

1. Log into your **Supabase** account
2. Open the **project** you want to connect to Pylar

## Step 2: Get Connection Details

1. At the top of your Supabase project, click the **"Connect"** button
2. You'll see connection options:
   - **Direct Connection** (for direct access)
   - **Transaction Pooler** (for pooled connections)
3. **Ignore the URI**—instead, click **"View Parameters"** to reveal the necessary connection details

<Info>
Supabase provides connection parameters rather than a single URI. You'll need to copy these individual parameters.
</Info>

## Step 3: Copy Connection Parameters

From the "View Parameters" view, copy the following details:

- **Host**: The Supabase database host
- **Port**: The database port (usually 5432)
- **Database Name**: The database name
- **User**: The database user

**Important**: Supabase does **not** provide the password in the connection details. You'll need to enter it manually in Pylar.

<Warning>
You'll need to know your Supabase database password. If you don't have it, you may need to reset it in Supabase settings.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Configure Pylar Connection

1. Open Pylar's **Connections** page
2. Select **PostgreSQL** as the database type (since Supabase is PostgreSQL-based)
3. Enter the connection details:

### Host

Paste the **Host** parameter from Supabase.

### Port

Enter the **Port** parameter (usually `5432`).

### Database Name

Enter the **Database Name** from Supabase.

### Username

Enter the **User** parameter from Supabase.

### Password

**Manually enter** your Supabase database password.

<Info>
Since Supabase doesn't provide the password in connection details, you must enter it manually. This is the password you set when creating your Supabase project or the one you've configured.
</Info>

## Step 5: Whitelist Pylar IP Address

**Critical Step**: Whitelist Pylar's IP address in Supabase.

**Pylar IP Address**: `34.122.205.142`

**How to whitelist in Supabase**:

1. In Supabase, go to **Project Settings** → **Database**
2. Scroll to **Connection Pooling** or **Network Restrictions**
3. Add `34.122.205.142` to the allowed IP addresses
4. Or configure your Supabase project's network access settings

<Warning>
Without whitelisting the IP address, Pylar will not be able to connect to your Supabase database. This step is crucial for establishing a secure connection.
</Warning>

## Step 6: Test and Connect

1. Click **"Connect"** or **"Submit"** in Pylar
2. Pylar will test the connection to your Supabase database
3. If successful, the connection will be established

## Step 7: Wait for Data Sync

After connecting:

1. **Data will begin syncing automatically**
2. You don't need to wait—Pylar will notify you via **email** once the data is available for querying
3. The sync process may take some time depending on data volume

<Check>
You'll receive an email notification when your Supabase data is ready to query. You can continue working while the sync happens in the background.
</Check>

## Using Your Supabase Connection

Once synced, you can query Supabase data just like any PostgreSQL database:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM supabase_connection.public.customers 
WHERE is_active = true;
```

## Connection Type Options

### Direct Connection

- **Use when**: You want direct database access
- **Best for**: Production workloads
- **Note**: May have connection limits

### Transaction Pooler

- **Use when**: You want pooled connections
- **Best for**: High-concurrency scenarios
- **Note**: Uses a different port (usually 6543)

<Tip>
Choose the connection type based on your needs. Direct Connection is simpler for most use cases, while Transaction Pooler helps with connection management.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Connection test fails

**Solutions**:
- Verify all parameters are copied correctly from Supabase
- Check database password is correct
- Ensure IP address `34.122.205.142` is whitelisted
- Verify Supabase project is active

### Issue: "Authentication failed" error

**Solutions**:
- Double-check database password
- Verify username matches Supabase user
- Check if password was reset recently
- Review Supabase user permissions

### Issue: "Connection refused" error

**Solutions**:
- Verify IP address is whitelisted in Supabase
- Check network restrictions in Supabase settings
- Ensure project is not paused
- Review Supabase project status

## Best Practices

### Password Security

- ✅ Use a strong database password
- ✅ Store password securely (password manager)
- ✅ Never share password publicly
- ✅ Rotate password periodically

### Connection Naming

- ✅ Use descriptive names: `supabase_prod`, `supabase_staging`
- ✅ Include environment information
- ✅ Be consistent across your workspace
