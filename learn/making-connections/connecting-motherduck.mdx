## Overview

Connecting Pylar to MotherDuck allows you to access and analyze your MotherDuck data directly from Pylar. MotherDuck is a serverless analytics platform, and connecting it to Pylar enables seamless data querying and analysis.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Pylar account with Analyst role or higher
- ✅ MotherDuck account
- ✅ Access to MotherDuck service token

## Step 1: Log in to MotherDuck

1. Start by logging into your **MotherDuck account**
2. Ensure you have access to account settings

## Step 2: Retrieve Service Token

1. Once logged in, click on your **username** in the upper right corner
2. Go to **"Settings"**
3. You will see a **service token** displayed
4. **Copy this token**—you'll need it to authenticate the connection with Pylar

<Warning>
Keep your service token secure. It provides access to your MotherDuck data. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Navigate to Pylar Connections

1. Switch to your Pylar workspace
2. Click on the **"Connections"** tab located in the sidebar
3. You'll see the list of available data sources

## Step 4: Select MotherDuck Connector

From the list of available data sources, select **"MotherDuck"**.

The connection setup screen will open.

## Step 5: Paste the Service Token

1. You will be prompted to enter your service token
2. **Paste the token** you copied from MotherDuck into the provided field
3. Double-check that the token is complete and correct

<Tip>
The service token is a long string. Make sure you copy the entire token without any truncation.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Confirm the Connection

1. After pasting the service token, click on the **"Confirm"** button
2. Pylar will validate the token and establish the connection

## Step 7: Verify Connection

1. You should now see that your MotherDuck account is connected to Pylar
2. The connection will appear in your connections list

## Querying Data from MotherDuck

Once connected, querying data is simple:

### Step 1: Go to Query Section

1. Navigate to the query section in your Pylar workspace
2. Open the SQL IDE

### Step 2: Run a Query

Enter your SQL query to fetch data from MotherDuck:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM motherduck_connection.database.table_name 
WHERE condition = 'value';
```

Reference your connection using the schema name you provided during setup.

### Step 3: View Results

Your query results will be displayed, showing how easy it is to access and analyze data from MotherDuck within Pylar.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid token" error

**Solutions**:
- Verify you copied the complete service token
- Check for any extra spaces or characters
- Ensure token hasn't expired (regenerate if needed)
- Verify token has necessary permissions

### Issue: Connection fails

**Solutions**:
- Double-check service token is correct
- Regenerate token in MotherDuck if needed
- Verify MotherDuck account is active
- Check network connectivity

### Issue: Data not appearing

**Solutions**:
- Wait for indexing to complete
- Verify database and table names are correct
- Check service token has access to the data
- Review MotherDuck permissions

## Best Practices

### Token Security

- ✅ Keep service token secure
- ✅ Regenerate token if compromised
- ✅ Use dedicated tokens for Pylar
- ✅ Monitor token usage in MotherDuck

### Connection Naming

- ✅ Use descriptive names: `motherduck_prod`, `motherduck_analytics`
- ✅ Include environment information
- ✅ Be consistent across your workspace
