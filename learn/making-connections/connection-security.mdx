## Data Security at Pylar

At Pylar, we understand the importance of data security. Our platform employs multiple layers of security to protect your data and credentials.

### Default Encryption

Pylar servers employ **default encryption** to safeguard your data:
- Data at rest is encrypted
- Data in transit is encrypted via HTTPS
- All API interactions use HTTPS protocol

### Secret Management

Sensitive information is stored securely:

- **Database Credentials**: Stored in Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Secret Key Manager
- **SQL Query Outputs**: Protected with robust access controls
- **Stringent Access Control**: Multiple layers of security

### HTTPS Protocol

All API interactions are fortified with HTTPS:
- **Encryption in Transit**: Data is encrypted during transmission
- **Protection Against Unauthorized Access**: Prevents interception and tampering
- **Secure Communication**: All connections use industry-standard encryption

<Info>
Pylar uses Google Cloud Platform's Secret Key Manager, which provides enterprise-grade security for storing and managing sensitive credentials.

## Enhancing Your Data Privacy

While Pylar provides a secure environment, you can take additional steps to further boost your data privacy.

### Creating a Dedicated User Account

For more granular control, consider setting up a **dedicated Pylar user account** in your database environment.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Assign Specific Access Rights**: Give Pylar only the permissions it needs
- ✅ **Establish Limited Views**: Control exactly what data Pylar can access
- ✅ **Utilize Audit Logging**: Monitor all queries executed by Pylar

**How to implement**:

1. Create a new database user specifically for Pylar
2. Grant only necessary permissions:
   ```sql
   -- Example for PostgreSQL
   CREATE USER pylar_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
   GRANT SELECT ON specific_schema.specific_table TO pylar_user;
   ```
3. Use this dedicated user when connecting to Pylar
4. Set up audit logging to track all Pylar queries

<Tip>
A dedicated user account with limited permissions is a security best practice. It follows the principle of least privilege—giving only the minimum access needed.
</Tip>

## IP Whitelisting

### Pylar IP Address

**Pylar IP Address**: `34.122.205.142`

This is a permanently assigned IP address. Whitelist it in your database firewall settings.

### Why Whitelist?

- **Security**: Restricts access to only Pylar's IP
- **Stability**: Ensures reliable connectivity
- **Control**: You control who can access your database

### How to Whitelist

The process varies by database provider:

- **AWS RDS**: Add to security group inbound rules
- **Google Cloud SQL**: Add to authorized networks
- **Azure Database**: Add to firewall rules
- **Self-hosted**: Configure server firewall (iptables, ufw, etc.)

<Warning>
Whitelisting the IP address is crucial for most database connections. Without it, Pylar may not be able to connect, and you may encounter network or security blocks.
</Warning>

## Network Security Best Practices

### Firewall Configuration

- ✅ **Whitelist Only**: Only allow Pylar's IP address
- ✅ **Restrict Ports**: Only open necessary database ports
- ✅ **Review Regularly**: Periodically review firewall rules
- ✅ **Monitor Access**: Log and monitor connection attempts

### VPN and Private Networks

For enhanced security:
- Use VPN connections when possible
- Configure private network access
- Use SSH tunnels for additional security (see SSH Connections guide)

## Credential Management

### Secure Storage

- ✅ **Never Share**: Don't share credentials publicly
- ✅ **Use Password Managers**: Store credentials securely
- ✅ **Rotate Regularly**: Change passwords periodically
- ✅ **Limit Access**: Only share with authorized team members

### Service Account Best Practices

For cloud databases (BigQuery, etc.):

- ✅ **Dedicated Accounts**: Create service accounts specifically for Pylar
- ✅ **Minimal Permissions**: Grant only necessary permissions
- ✅ **Key Rotation**: Rotate service account keys regularly
- ✅ **Monitor Usage**: Review service account activity logs

## Access Control

### Database-Level Security

- ✅ **User Permissions**: Use dedicated users with limited permissions
- ✅ **Schema-Level Access**: Restrict access to specific schemas
- ✅ **Table-Level Access**: Grant access only to necessary tables
- ✅ **View-Based Access**: Use database views to limit data exposure

### Audit Logging

Enable audit logging to monitor:

- **All Queries**: Track every query Pylar executes
- **Access Patterns**: Understand how data is being accessed
- **Security Events**: Identify suspicious activity
- **Compliance**: Maintain audit trails for compliance

## Views as Security Layer

### Views Are the Only Access Level

Remember: **Views are the only access level agents get**. This means:

- ✅ **No Raw Access**: Agents never access raw database tables
- ✅ **Controlled Data**: You define exactly what data is available
- ✅ **Additional Security Layer**: Views provide an extra security boundary

### Best Practices for Views

- ✅ **Filter Sensitive Data**: Exclude PII, financial data, etc.
- ✅ **Row-Level Security**: Implement filters based on context
- ✅ **Column-Level Security**: Select only necessary columns
- ✅ **Documentation**: Document what each view exposes

## Compliance and Auditing

### Compliance Requirements

Pylar helps you meet regulatory requirements:

- **SOC 2**: Security controls and audit trails
- **GDPR**: Data access controls and logging
- **HIPAA**: Protected health information controls
- **Other Regulations**: Customizable access controls

### Audit Trails

Pylar provides:

- **Query Logs**: Every query is logged
- **Access Logs**: Who accessed what and when
- **Evals**: Comprehensive usage analytics
- **Export Capabilities**: Export logs for compliance reviews

## Security Checklist
