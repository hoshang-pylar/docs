## Overview

Once you've created connections in Pylar, you can manage them from the Connections page. This includes viewing connection details, testing connections, editing configurations, and removing connections when no longer needed.

## Accessing Connections

1. In your Pylar workspace, click on the **"Connections"** tab in the sidebar
2. You'll see a list of all your connections
3. Each connection shows its status and basic information

## Viewing Connections

### Connection List

The Connections page displays:

- **Connection Name**: The schema name you assigned
- **Type**: Database type (BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Status**: Connection status (Active, Indexing, Error, etc.)
- **Last Sync**: When data was last synced (for Business Applications)
- **Last Indexed**: When data was last indexed (for Databases)

### Connection Details

Click on a connection to view:

- **Connection Information**: Host, database name, credentials (masked)
- **Sync Status**: Current sync/indexing progress
- **Data Statistics**: Number of tables, schemas indexed
- **Usage Information**: How often the connection is used

## Testing Connections

### Test Existing Connection

1. Go to the Connections page
2. Find the connection you want to test
3. Click **"Test Connection"** or similar button
4. Pylar will verify the connection is working

### What Gets Tested

- **Network Connectivity**: Can Pylar reach your database?
- **Authentication**: Are credentials valid?
- **Permissions**: Does the user have necessary access?
- **Database Access**: Can Pylar query the database?

<Check>
Regular testing helps identify connection issues before they affect your workflows. Test connections periodically or after making changes.
</Check>

## Editing Connections

### When to Edit

You may need to edit connections to:
- Update credentials (password changed)
- Modify connection settings
- Change database name
- Update host or port information

### How to Edit

1. Go to the Connections page
2. Find the connection you want to edit
3. Click **"Edit"** or the connection name
4. Modify the settings you need to change
5. **Test the connection** after making changes
6. Save your changes

<Warning>
Editing connection credentials may temporarily interrupt data access. Test the connection after making changes to ensure it still works.
</Warning>

## Connection Health Monitoring

### Status Indicators

Connections show status indicators:

- ✅ **Active**: Connection is working correctly
- ⏳ **Indexing**: Data is being indexed (for databases)
- ⏳ **Syncing**: Data is being synced (for Business Applications)
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Connection has issues but still works
- ❌ **Error**: Connection has failed

### Monitoring Health

- **Regular Checks**: Pylar periodically checks connection health
- **Notifications**: You'll be notified if connections fail
- **Status Updates**: Connection status updates automatically
- **Logs**: Review connection logs for issues

## Removing Connections

### When to Remove

Remove connections when:
- You no longer need the data source
- The database has been decommissioned
- You're consolidating connections
- Cleaning up unused connections

### How to Remove

1. Go to the Connections page
2. Find the connection you want to remove
3. Click **"Delete"** or **"Remove"**
4. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Removing a connection will:
- Break any views that depend on it
- Remove the connection from your workspace
- Stop all syncing/indexing

Make sure you no longer need the connection before removing it.
</Warning>

## Connection Status

### Active Connections

- **Working correctly**: Can query data
- **Synced/Indexed**: Data is available
- **Ready to use**: Can be used in views and queries

### Indexing/Syncing

- **In progress**: Data is being processed
- **Wait for completion**: You'll be notified when done
- **Can't query yet**: Wait for process to complete

### Error Status

- **Connection failed**: Check credentials and network
- **Authentication error**: Verify username/password
- **Network error**: Check IP whitelisting and firewall

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring

- ✅ Check connection status regularly
- ✅ Test connections after credential changes
- ✅ Monitor connection health
- ✅ Review error notifications promptly

### Connection Organization

- ✅ Use descriptive names
- ✅ Include environment (prod, staging, dev)
- ✅ Group related connections
- ✅ Document connection purposes

### Maintenance

- ✅ Update credentials before they expire
- ✅ Test connections after infrastructure changes
- ✅ Remove unused connections
- ✅ Review connection permissions periodically

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

### Connection Appears Offline

**Solutions**:
- Test the connection
- Check network connectivity
- Verify credentials haven't changed
- Review connection logs

### Sync/Index Never Completes

**Solutions**:
- Check for very large datasets
- Verify connection is still active
- Review error messages
- Contact support if needed

### Can't Query Data

**Solutions**:
- Verify connection status is "Active"
- Check if indexing/syncing is complete
- Review database permissions
- Test connection manually
