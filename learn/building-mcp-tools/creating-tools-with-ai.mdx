## Overview

Pylar's AI makes creating MCP tools effortless. Simply describe what you want in natural language, and the AI generates a complete, ready-to-use tool for you. This guide walks you through creating your first AI-generated tool.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a tool, ensure you have:

- ✅ A view created in your project
- ✅ The view selected in the right sidebar
- ✅ Access to Pylar AI (available in the right sidebar)

<Info>
The Pylar AI assistant is always available in the right sidebar. It understands your data structure and can generate tools tailored to your views.
</Info>

## Step 1: Select Your View

Before asking the AI to create a tool, you need to select the view you want to build the tool on.

1. Navigate to your project
2. Find the view you want to use
3. **Select the view in the right sidebar** - Make sure it's highlighted/selected

<Tip>
The AI needs to know which view you're working with. Always select your view before asking the AI to create a tool.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Ask the AI to Create a Tool

Once your view is selected, use the Pylar AI to create your tool.

### Using Natural Language

In the right sidebar, you'll see the Pylar AI. Simply describe what you want the tool to do in plain English.

### Example Request

Let's create an MCP tool that returns engagement scores for a given event type:

**Ask the AI**: *"Create an MCP tool to compute the engagement score for a given event type"*

### What the AI Does

When you submit your request, the AI:

1. **Analyzes Your View**: Understands the structure of your selected view
2. **Interprets Your Request**: Understands what you want the tool to do
3. **Generates SQL Query**: Creates a SQL query tailored to your use case
4. **Defines Parameters**: Identifies what inputs the tool needs
5. **Creates Tool Structure**: Builds the complete MCP tool configuration

<Check>
The AI generates a complete, production-ready tool. You can use it as-is or refine it further.
</Check>

## Step 3: Review the Generated Tool

Once the AI finishes generating, your new tool appears in the **"MCP Tools"** section of the right sidebar.

### What You'll See

The AI-generated tool includes:

- **Function Name**: A descriptive name for the tool
- **Description**: What the tool does (used by agents)
- **SQL Query**: The query that retrieves data
- **Parameters**: Inputs the tool accepts
- **Tool Call Arguments**: Test values for verification

### Example Generated Tool

For our engagement score example, the AI might generate:

- **Function Name**: `fetch_engagement_scores_by_event_type`
- **Description**: "Fetches engagement scores and related data filtered by event type"
- **SQL Query**: 
  ```sql
  SELECT engagement_score 
  FROM table0 
  WHERE event_type LIKE '%{event_type}%' 
  ORDER BY engagement_score DESC
  ```
- **Parameter**: `event_type` (string, required)

<Tip>
The AI uses placeholders like `{event_type}` in queries. When an agent calls the tool, it provides the actual value, which replaces the placeholder.
</Tip>

## Understanding the Generated Query

The AI-generated SQL query is tailored to your request:

### Query Structure

```sql
SELECT engagement_score 
FROM table0 
WHERE event_type LIKE '%{event_type}%' 
ORDER BY engagement_score DESC
```

**What This Does**:
- Selects `engagement_score` from your view (table0)
- Filters by `event_type` using a LIKE pattern match
- Uses `{event_type}` as a parameter placeholder
- Orders results by engagement score (highest first)

### Parameter Injection

When an agent calls this tool:
- Agent provides: `event_type = "login"`
- Query becomes: `WHERE event_type LIKE '%login%'`
- Returns: All engagement scores for login events

<Info>
The `LIKE '%{event_type}%'` pattern allows partial matching. This means searching for "log" will match "login", "logout", etc.
</Info>

## Refining AI-Generated Tools

The AI creates a solid foundation, but you can refine it:

### Common Refinements

1. **Adjust Query Logic**: Modify the SQL to better match your needs
2. **Add Filters**: Include additional WHERE conditions
3. **Change Parameters**: Add or remove parameters
4. **Update Description**: Make it clearer for agents
5. **Rename Function**: Use a more descriptive name

<Tip>
Start with the AI-generated tool, then refine it based on your specific requirements. The AI gives you a great starting point.
</Tip>

## Best Practices for AI Prompts

### Write Clear Requests

**Good Examples**:
- *"Create an MCP tool to get customer revenue for a specific date range"*
- *"Build a tool that returns top products by sales in a given category"*
- *"Make a tool to find customers with high engagement scores"*

**Avoid Vague Requests**:
- ❌ "Make a tool" (too vague)
- ❌ "Get data" (not specific enough)
- ❌ "Something for customers" (unclear purpose)

### Include Key Details

Mention:
- **What data** you want (engagement scores, revenue, etc.)
- **How to filter** (by event type, date range, customer ID, etc.)
- **How to sort** (highest first, most recent, etc.)

### Examples of Effective Prompts

**Example 1: Filtering by Date**
*"Create an MCP tool to get sales data for a specific date range, ordered by amount descending"*

**Example 2: Multiple Filters**
*"Build a tool that returns customer information filtered by region and account type"*

**Example 3: Aggregations**
*"Create a tool to calculate average order value for a given product category"*
