## Overview

Windsurf is an AI-powered code editor that supports MCP tools. Connect your Pylar tools to Windsurf to give the AI assistant access to your data through governed views while coding.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Windsurf editor installed
- ✅ Pylar project with published MCP tools
- ✅ MCP HTTP Stream URL and Bearer Token from Pylar

## Step 1: Get Your Pylar Credentials

1. In Pylar, navigate to your project
2. Click **"Publish"** in the right sidebar
3. Generate your token if needed
4. Copy both:
   - **MCP HTTP Stream URL**: `https://mcp.publish.pylar.ai/mcp`
   - **Authorization Bearer Token**: Your unique token

## Step 2: Open Windsurf Command Palette

1. Open Windsurf
2. Press the keyboard shortcut:
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + P`
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
3. Type and select: **"Windsurf: Open MCP Configuration"**

This opens or creates your MCP config file, usually located at:
```
~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
```

## Step 3: Add Your MCP Server Configuration

Inside the JSON file, add a new entry under `"mcpServers"`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "view-mcp-node": {
      "serverUrl": "https://mcp.publish.pylar.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer xxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**:
- Replace `xxxxx` with your actual Bearer Token from Pylar
- The name `"view-mcp-node"` is a local alias—you can rename it to anything you prefer
- If the `"headers"` key is unsupported in your Windsurf build, omit it and use a proxy or environment variable instead

<Info>
The config file location may vary. Windsurf will create it if it doesn't exist when you open the MCP Configuration.
</Info>

## Step 4: Save and Reload MCP Servers

1. Save the `mcp_config.json` file
2. Back in Windsurf, open the command palette again:
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + P`
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
3. Run: **"Windsurf: Reload MCP Servers"**

You'll see a success toast notification, and your new MCP server will appear in the MCP sidebar under the name you used (e.g., `view-mcp-node`).

<Check>
If you see the success toast and your MCP server appears in the sidebar, the connection is successful!
</Check>

## Step 5: Test the MCP Tools

1. Go to the chat in Windsurf
2. Write a question that requires the agent to use the MCP tool

**Example**: *"Use the engagement score tool to get scores for login events"*

The AI assistant will:
1. Recognize it needs to use your Pylar tool
2. Call the tool with appropriate parameters
3. Execute the query and return results
4. Use the data to answer your question

## Using Your Tools in Windsurf

Once connected, you can use Pylar tools while coding:

- Ask questions about your data
- Have the AI use tools to retrieve information
- Build applications with real data from your views
- Get insights while coding

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: MCP server not appearing

**Solutions**:
- Verify the JSON syntax is correct
- Check that you saved the config file
- Ensure you ran "Reload MCP Servers" command
- Verify Bearer Token is correct
- Check Windsurf version supports MCP

### Issue: Headers not supported

If headers are unsupported in your Windsurf build:

**Alternative Solutions**:
- Use a proxy server to add authentication
- Set authentication via environment variables
- Check for Windsurf updates

### Issue: Tools not working

**Solutions**:
- Verify tools are published in Pylar
- Check tool names match exactly
- Review error messages in Windsurf
- Test tools in Pylar first

## Benefits

- ✅ **AI-Powered Coding**: Access your data while coding
- ✅ **Natural Language**: Ask questions in plain English
- ✅ **Secure Access**: Through governed views only
- ✅ **Automatic Updates**: View changes reflect immediately
- ✅ **Full Control**: Manage everything from Pylar
