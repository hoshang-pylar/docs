## Overview

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that supports MCP tools. Connect your Pylar tools to Cursor to give the AI assistant access to your data through governed views while coding.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Cursor editor installed
- ✅ Pylar project with published MCP tools
- ✅ MCP HTTP Stream URL and Bearer Token from Pylar

## Step 1: Get Your Pylar Credentials

1. In Pylar, navigate to your project
2. Click **"Publish"** in the right sidebar
3. Generate your token if needed
4. Copy both:
   - **MCP HTTP Stream URL**: `https://mcp.publish.pylar.ai/mcp`
   - **Authorization Bearer Token**: Your unique token

## Step 2: Configure Cursor

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to **Settings** → **Features** → **MCP**
3. Or open Cursor settings file directly

## Step 3: Add Pylar MCP Server

Add Pylar to your MCP configuration:

**Configuration Path**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or Cursor settings

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pylar": {
      "url": "https://mcp.publish.pylar.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual Bearer Token.

## Step 4: Restart Cursor

1. Save the configuration
2. Restart Cursor
3. Cursor will connect to your Pylar MCP server

## Step 5: Verify Connection

1. Open a chat with Cursor's AI
2. Ask: *"What MCP tools do you have available?"*
3. Cursor should list your Pylar tools

## Using Your Tools in Cursor

Once connected, you can use Pylar tools while coding:

**Example**: *"Use the customer revenue tool to get data for account ID 12345"*

Cursor will:
1. Call your Pylar MCP tool
2. Retrieve data from your view
3. Use the data in your code or conversation
4. Help you build applications with real data

## Benefits

- ✅ **Code with Real Data**: Access your data while coding
- ✅ **AI Assistance**: Cursor can use your tools to answer questions
- ✅ **Secure**: Data access through governed views only
- ✅ **Automatic Updates**: View changes reflect immediately
- ✅ **Full Control**: Manage everything from Pylar

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Cursor can't connect

**Solutions**:
- Verify configuration file location
- Check Bearer Token format
- Ensure tools are published
- Restart Cursor

### Issue: Tools not appearing

**Solutions**:
- Check MCP configuration syntax
- Verify token is correct
- Review Cursor logs for errors
- Test connection in Pylar first
