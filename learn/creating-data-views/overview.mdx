## What Are Data Views?

Data views in Pylar are SQL queries that define exactly what data AI agents can access. Think of views as a **window** into your data—agents can only see and query through these windows, never gaining direct access to your raw database tables.

## Views vs Raw Database Access

### The Problem with Direct Access

Giving AI agents direct database access means:

- ❌ Agents can query any table or column
- ❌ No control over what data is exposed
- ❌ Security risks from accidental or malicious queries
- ❌ Difficult to audit and monitor access
- ❌ Compliance challenges

### The Pylar Solution: Views

With Pylar views:

- ✅ **Complete Isolation**: Agents only access data through your defined views
- ✅ **Fine-Grained Control**: You decide exactly what data is available
- ✅ **Security by Design**: Views are the only access level—no exceptions
- ✅ **Full Audit Trail**: Every query goes through your views and is logged
- ✅ **Compliance Ready**: Easy to demonstrate data governance

<Warning>
Views are the **only** access level AI agents get. They never have direct database access, ensuring complete security and governance.
</Warning>

## How Views Work in Pylar

### The View Lifecycle

1. **Create**: Write SQL queries in Pylar's SQL IDE
2. **Test**: Run queries to verify results
3. **Save**: Save queries as views in your project
4. **Build Tools**: Create MCP tools on top of views
5. **Publish**: Make tools available to AI agents
6. **Monitor**: Use Evals to see how agents interact with views

### View Organization

Views are organized within **projects**:

- Each project contains multiple views
- Views can reference different data sources
- You can create views that join across multiple databases
- Projects help organize views by use case or team

<Info>
Projects provide a logical way to group related views and tools together. For example, you might have a "Customer Analytics" project with multiple views for different analysis needs.

## Key Concepts

### Views Are Queries

A view is essentially a saved SQL query:

- Write standard SQL queries
- Use any SQL features your database supports
- Join tables, filter data, aggregate results
- Cross-database joins are supported

### Views Are Secure

- Agents can only query through views
- You control what columns and rows are accessible
- Sensitive data can be excluded or masked
- Row-level security can be implemented

### Views Are Flexible

- Multiple MCP tools can be created on a single view
- Each tool can have different parameters or purposes
- Views can be updated anytime
- Changes reflect automatically in all connected agents

## Benefits of Using Views

### For Security Teams

- **Complete Control**: Define exactly what data agents can access
- **No Raw Access**: Eliminate the risk of direct database queries
- **Audit Trail**: Every query is logged and traceable
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements with clear data governance

### For Data Teams

- **SQL IDE**: Built-in editor makes view creation easy
- **Cross-Database Joins**: Combine data from multiple sources
- **Testing**: Verify queries before saving as views
- **Organization**: Keep views organized in projects

### For Developers

- **No Custom Code**: Define views with SQL, no integration code needed
- **Standard SQL**: Use familiar SQL syntax
- **Fast Iteration**: Update views and see changes immediately
- **Multiple Tools**: Create different tools on the same view
