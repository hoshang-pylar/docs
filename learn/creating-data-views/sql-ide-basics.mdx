## Introduction to the SQL IDE

When you create a new view in Pylar, the **SQL IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) appears in the center of your screen. This powerful editor provides everything you need to write, test, and refine SQL queries before saving them as views.

## The SQL IDE Interface

The SQL IDE is designed for efficiency and ease of use:

### Key Components

- **Datasource Selector**: Dropdown menu to select your data source
- **SQL Query Editor**: Main editing area for writing queries
- **Run Query Button**: Executes your query and displays results
- **Query Results Panel**: Shows query output, row counts, and execution metadata

## Selecting a Data Source

Before writing your query, you must select which data source to query.

### Step-by-Step

1. Locate the **"Select Datasource"** dropdown above the SQL IDE
2. Click the dropdown to reveal all available data sources
3. Choose your desired data source:
   - Connected databases (BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - **Local Dataframes** (for querying dataframes in your session)
4. If needed, navigate to the specific database, schema, or table within that source

<Tip>
The dropdown dynamically shows all active connections. Ensure your database connection is established and active before selecting it.
</Tip>

## Writing Your Query

Once you've selected a data source, replace the default query template with your SQL query.

### Basic Query Example

```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  customer_name,
  email,
  created_at
FROM customers
WHERE is_active = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Query Editor Features

Pylar's SQL IDE includes:

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Color-coded SQL keywords and identifiers
- **Auto-completion**: Intelligent suggestions for table and column names
- **Error Detection**: Visual indicators for syntax errors
- **Query Formatting**: Clean, readable code structure

## Running Your Query

Execute your query to see results and verify it works correctly.

### Execution Steps

1. **Review Your Query**: Double-check your SQL for accuracy
2. **Click "Run Query"**: Located in the top right of the center screen
3. **Wait for Execution**: A loader appears in the results section below the IDE
4. **View Results**: Once complete, results appear in the Query Results section

<Info>
The loader indicator shows that Pylar is processing your query. For large datasets, this may take a few moments.
</Info>

## Understanding Query Results

When your query executes successfully, the results panel displays comprehensive information.

### Results Panel Contents

- **Data Table**: Tabular view of your query results
  - Scrollable for large result sets
  - Column headers for easy reference
  - Formatted data for readability

- **Row Count**: Total number of rows returned by the query

- **Last Run Time**: Timestamp showing when the query was executed

- **Execution Metadata**: Additional details about query performance

<Check>
The results table is interactive—you can scroll, sort columns, and explore your data directly in the IDE.

## Best Practices

### Query Development

- **Start with SELECT ***: Begin by viewing all columns, then refine to specific columns
- **Test Incrementally**: Add filters, joins, and aggregations one step at a time
- **Use LIMIT**: When exploring large datasets, use `LIMIT` to speed up testing
- **Verify Results**: Always check row counts and sample data before finalizing

### Performance Optimization

- **Filter Early**: Apply `WHERE` clauses before joins to reduce data volume
- **Select Specific Columns**: Avoid `SELECT *` in production views when possible
- **Monitor Execution Time**: Pay attention to query performance during testing
