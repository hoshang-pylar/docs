## Overview

A Product Usage Analyst powered by Pylar analyzes product usage patterns, feature adoption rates, user engagement metrics, and identifies trends to inform product decisions.

## What the Agent Needs to Accomplish

The agent must:
- Analyze product usage patterns
- Track feature adoption rates
- Measure user engagement
- Identify usage trends
- Compare user segments
- Recommend feature improvements

## How Pylar Helps

Pylar enables the agent by:
- **Unified Usage View**: Combining product analytics, user data, and feature usage
- **Real-time Analysis**: Querying current usage patterns
- **Trend Identification**: Detecting usage trends over time
- **Segment Comparison**: Comparing usage across user segments
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Generating actionable product recommendations

## Without Pylar vs With Pylar

### Without Pylar

**Challenges**:
- ❌ Multiple analytics tools and data sources
- ❌ Manual usage analysis
- ❌ Difficult to correlate features with engagement
- ❌ Time-consuming trend identification

**Implementation Complexity**: ~4-5 weeks

### With Pylar

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Single endpoint for all usage data
- ✅ Automated usage analysis
- ✅ Real-time trend detection
- ✅ Easy feature comparison

**Implementation Complexity**: ~5-6 hours

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Connect Data Sources

1. **Connect Product Analytics** (User actions, events, feature usage)
2. **Connect User Data** (User segments, subscription tiers)
3. **Connect Product Catalog** (Features, releases)

### Step 2: Create Usage Views

**Feature Adoption View**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW feature_adoption AS
SELECT 
  f.feature_name,
  f.release_date,
  COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id) as total_users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN u.feature_used THEN u.user_id END) as adopted_users,
  (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN u.feature_used THEN u.user_id END) / 
   NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id), 0)) * 100 as adoption_rate,
  AVG(u.usage_count) as avg_usage_per_user,
  AVG(u.last_used_days_ago) as avg_days_since_last_use
FROM product.features f
LEFT JOIN analytics.feature_usage u ON f.feature_id = u.feature_id
GROUP BY f.feature_name, f.release_date;
```

**User Engagement View**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW user_engagement AS
SELECT 
  u.user_id,
  u.user_segment,
  u.subscription_tier,
  u.active_days_last_30,
  u.features_used_count,
  u.total_actions,
  u.last_activity_date,
  -- Engagement score
  (u.active_days_last_30 * 0.4 + 
   (u.features_used_count / 10) * 30 + 
   (u.total_actions / 100) * 30) as engagement_score
FROM analytics.user_usage u;
```

### Step 3: Create MCP Tools

**Tool 1: Analyze Feature Adoption**
- `analyze_feature_adoption(feature_name: string, days_back: number)`

**Tool 2: Get Usage Trends**
- `get_usage_trends(metric: string, period: string)`

**Tool 3: Compare User Segments**
- `compare_user_segments(segment1: string, segment2: string, metric: string)`

**Tool 4: Identify Usage Patterns**
- `identify_usage_patterns(feature_id: string, user_segment: string)`

## Example Agent Interactions

**User**: "How is the new dashboard feature being adopted?"

**Agent**: "Dashboard Feature Adoption:
- Adoption Rate: 42% (8,400 of 20,000 users)
- Average Usage: 12 times per user
- Top User Segment: Enterprise (65% adoption)
- Growth Trend: +15% week-over-week
- Recommendation: Promote to mid-market segment"

## Outcomes

- **Feature Adoption**: 30% improvement in adoption rates
- **User Engagement**: 25% increase in engagement
- **Product Decisions**: Data-driven feature prioritization
- **Trend Detection**: 60% faster identification of usage trends
