## Overview

A Sales Territory Optimizer agent powered by Pylar analyzes sales performance, geographic data, and account information to optimize territory allocation and identify growth opportunities.

## What the Agent Needs to Accomplish

The agent must:
- Analyze territory performance
- Balance workload across territories
- Identify growth opportunities
- Optimize territory boundaries
- Track account distribution
- Recommend territory adjustments

## How Pylar Helps

Pylar enables the agent by:
- **Unified Territory View**: Combining sales data, geographic data, and account information
- **Performance Analysis**: Real-time territory performance metrics
- **Workload Balancing**: Analyzing and optimizing rep workload
- **Growth Identification**: Identifying untapped opportunities

## Without Pylar vs With Pylar

### Without Pylar

**Challenges**:
- ❌ Manual territory analysis
- ❌ Complex data aggregation
- ❌ Limited visibility into territory performance
- ❌ Time-consuming optimization

**Implementation Complexity**: ~5-6 weeks

### With Pylar

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automated territory analysis
- ✅ Real-time performance tracking
- ✅ Data-driven optimization
- ✅ Easy territory adjustments

**Implementation Complexity**: ~6-7 hours

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Connect Data Sources

1. **Connect CRM** (Accounts, deals, rep assignments)
2. **Connect Geographic Data** (Territory boundaries, regions)
3. **Connect Sales Performance** (Rep performance, quota data)

### Step 2: Create Territory Views

**Territory Performance View**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW territory_performance AS
SELECT 
  t.territory_name,
  t.region,
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.account_id) as account_count,
  SUM(d.amount) as total_pipeline,
  SUM(CASE WHEN d.stage = 'Closed Won' THEN d.amount ELSE 0 END) as closed_won,
  COUNT(DISTINCT r.rep_id) as rep_count,
  AVG(r.quota_attainment) as avg_quota_attainment
FROM territories t
LEFT JOIN accounts a ON t.territory_id = a.territory_id
LEFT JOIN deals d ON a.account_id = d.account_id
LEFT JOIN reps r ON t.territory_id = r.territory_id
GROUP BY t.territory_name, t.region;
```

### Step 3: Create MCP Tools

**Tool 1: Analyze Territory Performance**
- `analyze_territory_performance(territory_name: string)`

**Tool 2: Optimize Territory Allocation**
- `optimize_territory_allocation(criteria: string)`

**Tool 3: Identify Growth Opportunities**
- `identify_growth_opportunities(region: string, min_value: number)`

**Tool 4: Balance Workload**
- `balance_workload(territory_id: string)`

## Example Agent Interactions

**User**: "Analyze territory performance in the West region"

**Agent**: "West Region Territory Analysis:
- Top Territory: California (45 accounts, $2.1M pipeline)
- Underperforming: Nevada (12 accounts, $300K pipeline)
- Recommendation: Redistribute 8 accounts from CA to NV
- Growth Opportunity: 15 untapped accounts in Oregon"

## Outcomes

- **Territory Balance**: 30% improvement
- **Rep Utilization**: 25% better distribution
- **Revenue Growth**: 20% increase in underperforming territories
- **Planning Efficiency**: 70% reduction in planning time
