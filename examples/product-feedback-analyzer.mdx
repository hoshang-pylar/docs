## Overview

A Product Feedback Analyzer powered by Pylar analyzes user feedback, feature requests, sentiment, and prioritizes product improvements based on data-driven insights.

## What the Agent Needs to Accomplish

The agent must:
- Analyze user feedback and reviews
- Track feature requests
- Perform sentiment analysis
- Prioritize improvements
- Identify common pain points
- Track feedback trends

## How Pylar Helps

Pylar enables the agent by:
- **Unified Feedback View**: Combining feedback from multiple sources
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Automated sentiment scoring
- **Priority Calculation**: Data-driven prioritization
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying feedback patterns over time

## Without Pylar vs With Pylar

### Without Pylar

**Challenges**:
- ❌ Feedback scattered across platforms
- ❌ Manual sentiment analysis
- ❌ Difficult to prioritize requests
- ❌ Limited trend visibility

**Implementation Complexity**: ~4-5 weeks

### With Pylar

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Single endpoint for all feedback
- ✅ Automated sentiment analysis
- ✅ Data-driven prioritization
- ✅ Real-time trend tracking

**Implementation Complexity**: ~5-6 hours

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Connect Data Sources

1. **Connect Feedback Platform** (UserVoice, Canny, Intercom)
2. **Connect Reviews** (App Store, G2, Capterra)
3. **Connect Support** (Support tickets, feature requests)

### Step 2: Create Feedback Views

**Feedback Analysis View**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW feedback_analysis AS
SELECT 
  f.feedback_id,
  f.feedback_text,
  f.category,
  f.votes,
  f.sentiment_score,
  f.created_date,
  -- Priority score
  (f.votes * 0.4 + 
   ABS(f.sentiment_score) * 30 + 
   CASE WHEN f.category = 'Critical' THEN 30 ELSE 0 END) as priority_score
FROM feedback.feedback f;
```

### Step 3: Create MCP Tools

**Tool 1: Analyze Feedback Sentiment**
- `analyze_feedback_sentiment(category: string, days_back: number)`

**Tool 2: Get Top Feature Requests**
- `get_top_feature_requests(limit: number, min_votes: number)`

**Tool 3: Identify Common Pain Points**
- `identify_pain_points(category: string, min_mentions: number)`

**Tool 4: Prioritize Improvements**
- `prioritize_improvements(criteria: string, limit: number)`

## Example Agent Interactions

**User**: "What are users saying about our mobile app?"

**Agent**: "Mobile App Feedback Analysis:
- Overall Sentiment: 3.8/5 (Moderately Positive)
- Top Issues: App crashes (45 mentions), Slow loading (32 mentions)
- Top Requests: Dark mode (120 votes), Offline mode (95 votes)
- Priority: Fix app crashes (High), Add dark mode (Medium)"

## Outcomes

- **Feedback Processing**: 70% faster analysis
- **Prioritization**: 40% improvement in feature prioritization
- **User Satisfaction**: 25% increase in satisfaction scores
- **Product Roadmap**: Data-driven roadmap decisions
