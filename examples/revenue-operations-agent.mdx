- Monitor pipeline health and identify risks
- Track quota attainment and performance
- Identify trends and patterns in revenue data
- Generate revenue reports and insights

## How Pylar Helps

Pylar enables the agent by:

- **Real-time Analytics**: Querying current revenue metrics and forecasts
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Joining CRM, billing, and finance data
- **Advanced Calculations**: Complex revenue calculations and forecasting
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying revenue patterns and trends

## Without Pylar vs With Pylar

- ❌ Manual revenue calculations and forecasting
- ❌ Complex data aggregation across systems
- ❌ Time-consuming report generation
- ❌ Limited real-time insights
- ❌ Difficult to track quota and performance

**Implementation Complexity**:
- 4-5 different system integrations
- Custom revenue calculation logic

- Complex data aggregation
- ~6-8 weeks development time

### With Pylar

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Single endpoint for all revenue data
- ✅ Automated revenue calculations
- ✅ Real-time forecasting
- ✅ Unified quota tracking
- ✅ Easy to update calculations
- ✅ Built-in analytics

**Implementation Complexity**:
- Connect 4-5 data sources (1.5 hours)
- Create revenue views (3 hours)
- Build MCP tools with AI (2 hours)
- Connect to agent builder (15 minutes)
- **Total: ~7 hours**

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Connect Data Sources

1. **Connect CRM** (Deals, opportunities, contracts)
2. **Connect Billing System** (Invoices, subscriptions, payments)
3. **Connect Finance System** (Revenue recognition, financial data)
4. **Connect Sales Activity** (Quota, performance data)

### Step 2: Create Revenue Views

**Revenue Forecast View**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW revenue_forecast AS
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', close_date) as forecast_month,
  SUM(amount * (probability / 100)) as weighted_revenue,
  SUM(amount) as best_case_revenue,
  COUNT(*) as deal_count,
  AVG(probability) as avg_probability
FROM crm.deals
WHERE close_date >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', close_date);
```

**Quota Tracking View**:
```sql
CREATE VIEW quota_tracking AS
SELECT 
  rep_name,
  quota_amount,
  SUM(closed_won_amount) as attained_amount,
  (SUM(closed_won_amount) / quota_amount) * 100 as quota_attainment_percent,
  SUM(weighted_pipeline) as pipeline_value,
  (SUM(weighted_pipeline) / quota_amount) * 100 as pipeline_coverage_percent
FROM sales.rep_performance
GROUP BY rep_name, quota_amount;
```

### Step 3: Create MCP Tools

**Tool 1: Get Revenue Forecast**
- `get_revenue_forecast(months_ahead: number, include_breakdown: boolean)`

**Tool 2: Track Quota Attainment**
- `get_quota_tracking(rep_name: string, period: string)`

**Tool 3: Analyze Pipeline Health**
- `analyze_pipeline_health(threshold: number)`

**Tool 4: Revenue Trend Analysis**
- `analyze_revenue_trends(period: string, metric: string)`

## Example Agent Interactions

**User**: "What's our revenue forecast for Q2?"

**Agent**: "Q2 Revenue Forecast:
- Weighted Forecast: $1.2M
- Best Case: $1.8M
- Pipeline Coverage: 3.2x quota
- Top Rep: Sarah Johnson (145% of quota)"

## Outcomes

- **Forecast Accuracy**: 30% improvement
- **Quota Visibility**: Real-time tracking
- **Pipeline Health**: 25% better pipeline management
- **Report Efficiency**: 85% reduction in report time
